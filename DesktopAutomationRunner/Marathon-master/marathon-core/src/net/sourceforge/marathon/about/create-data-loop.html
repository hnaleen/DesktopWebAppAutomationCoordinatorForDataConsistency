    <h1>Create a Data Loop (only on <b>Marathon<i>ITE</i></b>)</h1>
  </center>
  <p>Based on Marathon, Jalian Systems provides a commercial version with extra features and support. You can use MarathonITE and reduce
     the effort required for creating resilient test suites. Use the included extract method refactoring to reuse your test scripts.
     Perform exploratory or semi-automatic testing through MarathonITE and share the test scripts with the development team.</p> 
  <p>For those cases, where you would like to execute the same steps in a test script for different data, MarathonITE provides a data loop
      refactoring. Using this refactoring, you can convert a set of statements from a test script to execute multiple times while
      accessing the data from a CSV file.</p>
