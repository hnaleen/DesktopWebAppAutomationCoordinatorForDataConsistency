    <h1>Clean Object Map (only on <b>Marathon<i>ITE</i></b>)</h1>
  </center>
  <p>Based on Marathon, Jalian Systems provides a commercial version with extra features and support. You can use MarathonITE and reduce
     the effort required for creating resilient test suites. Use the included extract method refactoring to reuse your test scripts.
     Perform exploratory or semi-automatic testing through MarathonITE and share the test scripts with the development team.</p> 
  <p>Marathon records the name and recognition properties of the components in object map. Object map is stored as YAML files in the project
     folder. When using Marathon for long time, cruft started to accumulate in the object map files. The files might include details of 
     components that are not used or containers that are no longer referenced. It is advised to clean the object map files at regular intervals.
     Since all the files are text files any text editor can be used to modify these files.</p>
  <p>MarathonITE includes a set of options for cleaning up the object map entries. By marking all the components as used, followed by running all
      the test scripts while marking the used components and then cleaning up the object map files ensures that unneeded entries are removed 
      from the object map files.</p>
  <p>MarathonITE also includes an option to remove the container files that are no longer referenced in the test scripts.</p>
